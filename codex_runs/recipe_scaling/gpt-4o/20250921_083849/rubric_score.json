  "notes": "To improve: (1) Extend validator to ensure all original ingredients appear exactly once, enforce unit consistency, and detect duplicates and omissions. (2) Differentiate exact matches (+1) from near matches (+0.5). (3) Penalize both extra and missing ingredients. (4) Seed >10 diverse examples covering upscale, downscale, and fractional servings. (5) Consider a continuous reward based on percentage error to make the reward smoother across deviations."
