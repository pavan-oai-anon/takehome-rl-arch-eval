  "notes": "Strength: clear, continuous similarity-based reward via difflib that differentiates perfect vs partial fixes. Gaps: no explicit reward tiers or documentation, no semantic/intent checks, sparse metrics (no edit distance or exact-match flag), and no regression tests for edge cases. Consider adding tiered reward thresholds, logging edit distance and exact-match/unchanged flags, incorporating a lightweight semantic similarity check, and adding tests for all-caps, punctuation-only, and already-correct inputs."
