  "notes": "To improve: (1) Safely evaluate arithmetic expressions (e.g., parse AST and allow only +, -, *, /, parentheses) and compute the numeric result to compare to 24. (2) Verify all four provided digits are used exactly once by tokenizing and counting usage against the input digits. (3) Add reasoning scaffolding (e.g., request a <thinking>...</thinking> section or structured reasoning steps). (4) Implement a smooth reward shaping signal based on distance from 24 (e.g., 1 - min(1, abs(24 - result)/k)). (5) Enforce output format with explicit parsing and apply a formatting bonus/penalty."
