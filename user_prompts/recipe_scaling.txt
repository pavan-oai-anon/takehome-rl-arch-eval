Scale cooking recipes up or down for different serving sizes, adjusting all ingredients proportionally. Create an ART RL setup where env.py defines base recipes (ingredient quantities, units, original servings) and rollout.py accepts an agent response containing the scaled recipe in a clear JSON format (e.g., list of ingredient objects with `name`, `quantity`, `unit`). Reward is highest when the agent scales quantities exactly to the requested servings (+1), partial credit if off by <5% (+0.5), and penalties for missing ingredients or incorrect formatting (-1). Include metadata for percentage error per ingredient and a flag if any ingredient is omitted or extra. Follow the same scaffolding style as the other prompts with configurable recipes in env.py and the rollout logic handling validation.
