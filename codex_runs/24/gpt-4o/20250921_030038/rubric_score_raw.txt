You are an automated reviewer scoring an OpenPipe ART environment.
Evaluate the provided files using the rubric and then WRITE the score JSON to
/home/azureuser/probable-goggles-1/codex_runs/24/gpt-4o/20250921_030038/rubric_score.json. Use this structure exactly:
{
  "total_points": <number>,
  "criteria": [{"description": "...", "max_points": <number>, "awarded_points": <number>, "justification": "..."}, ...],
  "notes": "..."
}
After writing the file, output ONLY the text DONE so the caller knows you finished.

Rubric (10 points total):
Rubric – 24 Arithmetic Game Environment

Award points based on the quality of the environment implementation and reward shaping:
- 2 pts: Reward function properly executes the expression and checks to see if the expression equals 24. 
- 2 pts: Reward function makes sure that the expression uses all four digits exactly once.
- 4 pts: Environment and prompting is setup to elicit thinking / reasoning in a <thinking> tag or some equivalent manner.
- 1 pt: Reward function is smooth, where even if the expression is not exactly 24, there is a positive reward for being close to 24.
- 1 pt: There is either a penatly for not following the formatting the prompt demands, or a reward for following the formatting the prompt demands.
