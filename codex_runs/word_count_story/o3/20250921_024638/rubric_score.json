  "notes": "To reach full credit: (1) add tests for hyphenation, contractions, emoji and clarify tokenizer policy; (2) optionally expose a discrete tiered reward summary in metrics while keeping dense shaping; (3) implement a simple theme adherence metric (e.g., keyword overlap or embedding similarity) and incorporate it into reward or metadata; (4) log metrics with exact keys `count_difference` and `theme_match`; (5) add an output sanitizer that strips markup/markdown/XML and enforces plain text prior to counting."
