[2025-09-21T20:19:17] User instructions:
You are an automated reviewer scoring an OpenPipe ART environment.
Evaluate the provided files using the rubric and then WRITE the score JSON to
/home/azureuser/probable-goggles-1/codex_runs/tic_tac_toe/gpt-4o/20250921_080730/rubric_score.json. Use this structure exactly:
{
  "total_points": <number>,
  "criteria": [{"description": "...", "max_points": <number>, "awarded_points": <number>, "justification": "..."}, ...],
  "notes": "..."
}
After writing the file, output ONLY the text DONE so the caller knows you finished.

Rubric (10 points total):
Rubric – Tic-Tac-Toe Environment (10 pts total)

Award points for environment/reward craftsmanship:
- 2 pts: Board parser validates legal moves, enforces turn order, and rejects occupied squares with clear errors.
- 2 pts: Reward structure differentiates wins (+1), draws (e.g., +0.1 or 0), losses (-1), and illegal moves (-1) with documented rationale.
- 2 pts: Game state transitions correctly update board, toggle turns, and detect terminal conditions (win/draw) before issuing reward.
- 2 pts: Game adversary is some what complex, and not just random moves, or not implemented at all.
- 2 pts: Rollout properly implements a multiturn rollout, and not just a single turn rollout.

I’m going to write the rubric evaluation JSON to the specified path. Then I’ll confirm completion.
