  "notes": "Overall, the environment is sound: counting treats hyphens and contractions as intended and excludes emoji; reward blends closeness and theme coverage with an exact-count bonus; and metrics include all needed information though under different names. Areas to improve: add tests for edge cases; optionally rename metrics to match the requested keys; and strip/sanitize content prior to scoring to fully meet the sanitizer requirement."
