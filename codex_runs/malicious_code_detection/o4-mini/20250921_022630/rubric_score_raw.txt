[2025-09-21T20:12:52] User instructions:
You are an automated reviewer scoring an OpenPipe ART environment.
Evaluate the provided files using the rubric and then WRITE the score JSON to
/home/azureuser/probable-goggles-1/codex_runs/malicious_code_detection/o4-mini/20250921_022630/rubric_score.json. Use this structure exactly:
{
  "total_points": <number>,
  "criteria": [{"description": "...", "max_points": <number>, "awarded_points": <number>, "justification": "..."}, ...],
  "notes": "..."
}
After writing the file, output ONLY the text DONE so the caller knows you finished.

Rubric (10 points total):
Rubric â€“ Malicious Code Detection Environment

Award points for environment/reward craftsmanship:
- 3 pts: Sample code snippets that are malicious are not ovbious in their comments / code. It's by the nature of their code they are malicious, not other things.
- 2 pt: The samples seeded in the envionment are a variety of different languages, and not just one language.
- 2 pt: The samples seeded in the environment have a variety of difficulty - they are not all trivial examples, or exceptionally difficult to figure out if they are malicious or not.
- 2 pt: The rollouts are setup to extract out data in a structured format to make the judgement of correctness easier.
- 1 pt: The environment has a sufficient number of samples, more than 10.
