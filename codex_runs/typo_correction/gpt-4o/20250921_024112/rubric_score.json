  "notes": "env.py contains a syntax error (missing comma after 'base_model' in TRAINING_CONFIG). In rollout.py, reward logic is binary and tied to a substring check; consider a Levenshtein or token-level similarity for smoother rewards and partial credit. Also, trajectory.metrics may be used before initialization depending on the ART API. Expand the dataset to >10 varied examples and optionally tie difficulty to sampling or reward scaling."
