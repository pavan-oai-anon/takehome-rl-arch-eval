  "notes": "Overall, the environment sets a single target schema and provides fractional per-field rewards, enabling partial credit and smooth optimization. It lacks schema diversity across examples and does not penalize extra fields. Edge-case handling (e.g., empty inputs, spelled-out numbers, ambiguous prompts) is not addressed or documented. Adding multiple target schemas, explicit schema-conformance checks that penalize unexpected keys, and tests/comments for edge cases would strengthen the environment."
