  "notes": "Parsing of user moves lacks robust validation and can crash on malformed inputs. There is no opponent logic; consider adding at least a heuristic or minimax opponent and clearly defining which symbol the agent controls. Document reward choices and include explicit error messaging for illegal or malformed moves."
