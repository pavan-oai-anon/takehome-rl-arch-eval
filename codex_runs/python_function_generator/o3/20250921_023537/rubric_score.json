  "notes": "Strengths: solid AST + inspect-based signature check; clean test harness feeding reward; clear separation of flags for syntax/signature/test failures. Gaps: syntax_ok set before exec means code that fails at exec can still earn syntax credit; consider setting syntax_ok only after successful compile/exec. No docstring enforcement despite PEP 8/257 guidance; add checks for presence/format of docstrings when required. Metadata could include tests_passed/total and captured exception messages to aid analysis."
