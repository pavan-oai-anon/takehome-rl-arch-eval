Gaps to address: add explicit reward tiers (documented thresholds for exact/minor/major/unchanged), log edit distance and an unchanged flag, include a semantic drift heuristic (e.g., token/word overlap, keyword preservation, or lightweight embedding similarity) that influences reward/metadata, and add regression tests covering all-caps, punctuation-only, and already-correct inputs."
