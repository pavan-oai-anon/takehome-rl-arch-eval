[2025-09-21T20:18:47] User instructions:
You are an automated reviewer scoring an OpenPipe ART environment.
Evaluate the provided files using the rubric and then WRITE the score JSON to
/home/azureuser/probable-goggles-1/codex_runs/recipe_scaling/o4-mini/20250921_083849/rubric_score.json. Use this structure exactly:
{
  "total_points": <number>,
  "criteria": [{"description": "...", "max_points": <number>, "awarded_points": <number>, "justification": "..."}, ...],
  "notes": "..."
}
After writing the file, output ONLY the text DONE so the caller knows you finished.

Rubric (10 points total):
Rubric â€“ Recipe Scaling Environment (10 pts total)

Award points for environment/reward quality:
- 2 pts: Validator checks every ingredient is present once, quantities scale proportionally to target servings, and units remain consistent.
- 2 pts: Reward function differentiates exact match (+1), near match within 5% (+0.5), and penalties for missing/excess ingredients or formatting errors (-1).
- 2 pts: Examples seeded in the environment are a variety of different scaling tasks (upscale, downscale, fractional-serving, etc)
- 2 pts: More than 10 examples are seeded in the environment.
- 2 pts: Reward function is smooth, where even if we're not exactly correct, we still have some reward for being partially correct.
