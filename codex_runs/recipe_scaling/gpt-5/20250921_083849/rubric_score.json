  "notes": "Overall, the environment is well-structured with clear prompts and defensive parsing. Validation captures omissions and percent errors and tracks unit mismatches, but does not detect duplicate ingredients and does not enforce unit consistency in reward. The reward logic cleanly distinguishes exact/near matches and handles parse/missing errors at -1, with additional smooth shaping; however, extra ingredients are not a hard failure. Example coverage is limited to three base recipes and integer target servings."
