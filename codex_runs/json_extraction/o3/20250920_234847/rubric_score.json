  "notes": "Overall design provides clear partial-credit shaping and a perfect-match bonus. It lacks schema-compatibility enforcement beyond basic type normalization for amount and does not penalize extra fields. Only one schema is used across all examples, and edge-case coverage is limited to JSON parsing nuances."
