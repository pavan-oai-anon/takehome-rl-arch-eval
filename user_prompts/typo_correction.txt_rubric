Rubric â€“ Typo Correction Environment (10 pts total)

Award points for environment/reward quality:
- 2 pts: Automatic diffing (Levenshtein or token comparison) scores outputs and distinguishes exact match vs partial fixes.
- 2 pts: Reward tiers are documented (exact match, minor style difference, unchanged/introduces error) and implemented in code.
- 2 pts: Sentiment/intent checks (e.g., simple similarity or heuristic) flag meaning drift and feed into metadata/reward.
- 2 pts: Environment logs edit distance, unchanged flag, and semantic change indicator for analysis.
- 2 pts: Regression tests or golden examples ensure the validator handles all-caps, punctuation-only, and already-correct strings.
