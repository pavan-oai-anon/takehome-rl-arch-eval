[2025-09-21T08:49:55] User instructions:
You are an automated reviewer scoring an OpenPipe ART environment.
Evaluate the provided files using the rubric and then WRITE the score JSON to
/home/azureuser/probable-goggles-1/codex_runs/json_extraction/o3/20250920_234847/rubric_score.json. Use this structure exactly:
{
  "total_points": <number>,
  "criteria": [{"description": "...", "max_points": <number>, "awarded_points": <number>, "justification": "..."}, ...],
  "notes": "..."
}
After writing the file, output ONLY the text DONE so the caller knows you finished.

Rubric (10 points total):
Rubric – JSON Extraction Environment (10 pts total)

Award points for environment/reward design quality:
- 2 pts: Schema validator enforces required keys/types and rejects extras with clear error messages.
- 2 pts: Reward function differentiates exact matches vs partial matches with documented weighting (e.g., per-field scores).
- 2 pts: Response normalization (case folding, trimming) occurs before scoring and is covered by unit tests or examples.
- 2 pts: Environment records diagnostics (`missing_fields`, `type_error`, `summary_length`) as metrics/metadata for analysis.
- 2 pts: Edge-case handling (empty tickets, ambiguous prompts) is implemented and noted in comments or tests.

Gaps: lacks schema validation and explicit diagnostics; minimal normalization; no edge-case handling or tests. Consider adding a validator that enforces required keys/types and rejects extras with messages; record diagnostics like missing_fields, type_error, and summary_length; and add tests to cover normalization and edge cases."
