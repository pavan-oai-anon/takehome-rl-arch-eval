Create an ART reinforcement learning setup for Tic-Tac-Toe. The environment should present the board state (use an easy-to-parse text grid or coordinate list), whose turn it is, and any helper notes (e.g., last move). The agent must respond with a legal move in row/column notation (like `B2`). Reward the agent for winning (+1), penalize losses (-1), and give small shaping for draws (0.1) or illegal moves (-1). Include a rollout function that checks move legality, updates the board, and logs metadata (winner, board hash, illegal flag). Keep the scaffolding similar to the other prompts, with configurable game parameters in `env.py` and rollout logic in `rollout.py`.
