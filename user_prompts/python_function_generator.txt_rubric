Rubric â€“ Python Function Generator Environment (10 pts total)

Award points for environment/reward quality:
- 2 pts: AST-based validator checks syntax and exact signature (name, params, return type) before scoring.
- 2 pts: Reward structure differentiates between syntax errors, signature mismatches, logic failures, and full success.
- 2 pts: Automatic unit tests or assertions run per prompt, feeding pass/fail results into rewards. The environment should *actually* run the function and check to see if it is correct and compare it to the golden implementation.
- 2 pts: Environment enforces docstring/type hint requirements when specified, with clear penalties when missing.
- 2 pts: Reward function is smooth, where even if we're not exactly correct, we still have some reward for being partially correct.
