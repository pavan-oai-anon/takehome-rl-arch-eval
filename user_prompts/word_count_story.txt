Create an ART reinforcement learning task that makes the agent generate short stories with an exact word count. The environment should emit a prompt describing theme and required word length (e.g. 10 words, 20 words). Seed with 10â€“20 reference prompts and target solutions. The agent must return plain text that matches the requested word count exactly; log word count deviations as numeric metrics and record errors in metadata. Follow the existing scaffold conventions.
