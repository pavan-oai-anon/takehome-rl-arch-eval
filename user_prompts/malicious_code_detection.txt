Design an ART reinforcement learning task for classifying whether a code snippet is malicious. The environment should present one snippet per episode along with minimal context (language, filename). Seed the environment with 10â€“20 examples covering benign utilities and common malware techniques. The agent must respond in JSON with fields `is_malicious` (boolean) and `explanation` (short string). Make sure rollouts validate the JSON structure and log invalid responses as numeric metrics. Follow the same scaffolding style as the other prompts.
