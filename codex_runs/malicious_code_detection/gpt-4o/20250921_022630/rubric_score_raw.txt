[2025-09-21T08:51:18] User instructions:
You are an automated reviewer scoring an OpenPipe ART environment.
Evaluate the provided files using the rubric and then WRITE the score JSON to
/home/azureuser/probable-goggles-1/codex_runs/malicious_code_detection/gpt-4o/20250921_022630/rubric_score.json. Use this structure exactly:
{
  "total_points": <number>,
  "criteria": [{"description": "...", "max_points": <number>, "awarded_points": <number>, "justification": "..."}, ...],
  "notes": "..."
}
After writing the file, output ONLY the text DONE so the caller knows you finished.

Rubric (10 points total):
Rubric – Malicious Code Detection Environment

Award points for environment/reward craftsmanship:
- 2 pts: Static analysis heuristics (network calls, file wipes, credential access) populate signals used in rewards.
- 2 pts: Reward logic grants distinct scores for correct classification, partial credit for right reasoning with wrong label, and penalties for contradictions.
- 2 pts: JSON schema check enforces exact response format and surfaces descriptive errors.
- 2 pts: Metadata logs heuristic flags and raw snippet context to aid debugging.
- 2 pts: Unit tests or fixtures cover benign vs malicious examples across languages/file types.
- 3 pts: Sample code snippets that are malicious are not ovbious in their comments / code. It's by the nature of their code they are malicious, not other things.
