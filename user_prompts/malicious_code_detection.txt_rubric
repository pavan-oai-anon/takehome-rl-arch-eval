Rubric â€“ Malicious Code Detection Environment

Award points for environment/reward craftsmanship:
- 2 pts: Static analysis heuristics (network calls, file wipes, credential access) populate signals used in rewards.
- 2 pts: Reward logic grants distinct scores for correct classification, partial credit for right reasoning with wrong label, and penalties for contradictions.
- 2 pts: JSON schema check enforces exact response format and surfaces descriptive errors.
- 2 pts: Metadata logs heuristic flags and raw snippet context to aid debugging.
- 2 pts: Unit tests or fixtures cover benign vs malicious examples across languages/file types.
- 3 pts: Sample code snippets that are malicious are not ovbious in their comments / code. It's by the nature of their code they are malicious, not other things.
