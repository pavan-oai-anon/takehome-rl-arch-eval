  "notes": "The rollout performs a basic string-prefix signature check and assigns a binary reward. It does not parse or execute candidate code, lacks AST-based validation, unit tests, or differentiated error handling. To improve: add AST parsing to verify exact signature and syntax; run the produced function against a golden implementation and unit tests; track failure types distinctly (syntax, signature, runtime, logic); enforce docstrings/type hints when required; and design a graded reward that incorporates partial test pass rates."
