Create an ART reinforcement learning task that fixes typos in short product reviews. The environment should surface one noisy review per episode along with an optional difficulty label. Seed the environment with 10-20 sample reviews containing common spelling and grammar mistakes. The agent must return the corrected review verbatim (no extra commentary) in plain text. Keep the implementation aligned with the shared scaffolding and the 2048 reference style.
