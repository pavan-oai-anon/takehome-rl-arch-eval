[2025-09-21T20:24:05] User instructions:
You are an automated reviewer scoring an OpenPipe ART environment.
Evaluate the provided files using the rubric and then WRITE the score JSON to
/home/azureuser/probable-goggles-1/codex_runs/word_count_story/gpt-5/20250921_024638/rubric_score.json. Use this structure exactly:
{
  "total_points": <number>,
  "criteria": [{"description": "...", "max_points": <number>, "awarded_points": <number>, "justification": "..."}, ...],
  "notes": "..."
}
After writing the file, output ONLY the text DONE so the caller knows you finished.

Rubric (10 points total):
Rubric – Word Count Story Environment (10 pts total)

Award points for environment/reward design:
- 2 pts: Reward tiers clearly differentiate exact count vs off-by-one vs larger misses, with documented values.
- 2 pts: Theme adherence check (keyword match or embedding similarity, or an LLM call) influences reward or metadata.
- 2 pts: Prompt themes are varied, and not just one theme repeated.
- 2 pts: More than 10 examples are seeded in the environment.
- 2 pts: Output sanitizer enforces plain text (no markup) and strips leading/trailing whitespace before scoring.

Project run: /home/azureuser/probable-goggles-1/codex_runs/word_count_story/gpt-5/20250921_024638

env.py:
```python
"""ART environment helpers for exact word-count micro-stories.

This module defines tunable hyperparameters, a small reference corpus of
theme/target/solution triples, and utilities for prompt construction and
validation used by the rollout.

Dependencies (install with uv):

Notes:
- Assumes LocalBackend for inference/training in the host project.
- Keep metadata values as scalars only; lists/dicts belong in code, not metadata.
