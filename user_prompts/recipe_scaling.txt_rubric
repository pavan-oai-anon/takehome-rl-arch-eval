Rubric â€“ Recipe Scaling Environment (10 pts total)

Award points for environment/reward quality:
- 2 pts: Validator checks every ingredient is present once, quantities scale proportionally to target servings, and units remain consistent.
- 2 pts: Reward function differentiates exact match (+1), near match within 5% (+0.5), and penalties for missing/excess ingredients or formatting errors (-1).
- 2 pts: Examples seeded in the environment are a variety of different scaling tasks (upscale, downscale, fractional-serving, etc)
- 2 pts: More than 10 examples are seeded in the environment.
- 2 pts: Reward function is smooth, where even if we're not exactly correct, we still have some reward for being partially correct.
