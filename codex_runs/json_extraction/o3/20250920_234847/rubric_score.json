  "notes": "Strengths: simple, deterministic sampling; clear per-field reward with perfect-match bonus. Gaps: lacks schema validation and explicit diagnostics; minimal normalization; no edge-case handling or tests. Consider adding a validator that enforces required keys/types and rejects extras with messages; record diagnostics like missing_fields, type_error, and summary_length; and add tests to cover normalization and edge cases."
