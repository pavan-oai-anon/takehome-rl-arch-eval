  "notes": "Overall, the environment cleanly validates syntax and signature (excluding return type) and uses per-scenario tests to compute a smooth reward. It distinguishes failure modes via metadata/metrics. It does not enforce docstring/type hints and does not compare generated behavior directly to the golden function."
