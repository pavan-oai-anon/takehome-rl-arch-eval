  "notes": "The rollout performs a minimal string-based signature check and sets a binary reward. There is no AST/syntax validation, no execution or unit testing of the generated function, no differentiation among failure types (syntax vs signature vs logic), and no enforcement of docstrings/type hints. Metadata only records an error string without structured booleans for syntax_ok/signature_ok/tests_passed. Consider adding ast.parse-based validation, explicit signature checking, a per-prompt test harness, tiered rewards, docstring/type hint enforcement, and richer metadata."
