Design an ART reinforcement learning task that extracts structured JSON from unstructured data. The environment should emit a piece of text containing free-form text and metadata fields. You probably want to seed the environment with 10-20 examples. The agent must return a JSON object, ensuring the response is valid JSON and fields follow the prompted schema. Reuse the shared project scaffolding and keep the ergonomics close to the 2048 reference.
