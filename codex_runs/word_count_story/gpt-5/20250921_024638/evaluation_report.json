Ensure it is plain text with no code fences or metadata. If multiple lines are present, join them with single spaces before counting.\n2) Count words using these rules:\n   - Split on whitespace (one or more whitespace characters are delimiters).\n   - Do not split on punctuation; punctuation attached to a token stays with that token.\n   - Hyphenated compounds count as one word (e.g., \"fire-lit\" is one).\n   - Contractions and numerals count as one word (e.g., \"don't\", \"2025\").\n3) Compute: required_word_count = 12; actual_word_count = count(tokens); word_count_deviation = abs(actual - required).\n4) Thematic check (lightweight): response should clearly evoke the theme; it should include at least one of these anchor words or clear synonyms: \"dragon\" or \"village\". Mark theme_match = 1 if present, else 0.\n5) Plain-text check: no code fences, JSON, or markup. If detected, set error_type = \"non_plain_text\".\n\nPass criteria:\n- word_count_deviation == 0 AND theme_match == 1 AND no non-plain-text formatting.\n\nMetrics to record:\n- required_word_count: 12\n- actual_word_count: integer\n- word_count_deviation: integer\n- theme_match: 0/1\n\nErrors metadata (set error_type to first applicable):\n- \"word_count_mismatch\" if deviation != 0\n- \"off_theme\" if theme_match == 0 (only if no word count mismatch)\n- \"non_plain_text\" if formatting is not plain text\n\nNotes on edge cases:\n- Multiple spaces or newlines are acceptable after normalization; only the final token count matters.\n- Emojis count as one token if separated by spaces.\n- Do not penalize grammar or punctuation if word count and theme are satisfied.",

Contractions and hyphenated forms count as one word if they contain no spaces.\n3) Compute metrics:\n   - expected_count = 10\n   - generated_count = number of tokens after normalization\n   - word_count_deviation = abs(generated_count - expected_count)\n4) Pass criteria: word_count_deviation == 0.\n5) Metadata errors:\n   - If word_count_deviation != 0, add \"word_count_mismatch: expected 10, got {generated_count}\".\n   - If output contains any non-plain-text markup (e.g., backticks, markdown list markers like '-', '*', numbered list prefixes like '1.', HTML tags), add \"non_plain_text\".\n6) Content/theme: do not hard-match references; only check that it is a coherent story-like sentence roughly aligned with the theme. Minor deviations in theme are acceptable; do not fail on theme.\n7) Record metrics as numeric fields (expected_count, generated_count, word_count_deviation) and errors as a list of strings in metadata.\n\nNotes on counting examples:\n- \"key,\" counts as one word; \"life-changing\" counts as one; \"don't\" counts as one.\n- Multiple lines are allowed; count words across all lines after normalization.",
